The brand new League of Legends organization, NRG, owned by Sacramento Kings owner, apparently, signing what was formerly Coast's organization, buying it off them, but not signing the players, and making this new roster, has sparked a level of outrage which ties back into a previous incident, or scandal, whatever you want to call it, that involved Coast from last year. And this is a topic which I find a little bit confusing, because people's outrage, while I can understand and sympathize with some of the base reasons or emotions behind it, doesn't seem to be well-placed or logically thought out, and the reasons behind it don't seem to be very well defined, yet they're calling for like rule change, or something must be done. Yet it seems like the people who are out just don't necessarily know exactly what they want doing, or how it would reasonably implemented across all teams, not just this specific case.
So first of all, let's just break down the details of this. It all began last year in 2014, when Coast had gotten relegated from, after the Spring split of that year, and if you remember, after the relegation, ZionSpartan, Shiphtur, were superstar acquisitions over to Dignitas, and so Coast essentially had to start again with a lot of its lineup - NintendudeX left. They were put in a position where they had to build a whole new roster and so they put together this roster which had a number of players you probably know, they had Rhux, they had Santorin, they had Goldenglue, they had WizFujiin, now known as Apollo, they had Sheep. Later on they would get DontMashMe, as like a sub or something, and what happened was they were going through all these pre-summer season tournaments, they were trying to qualify, they were looking at all the tournaments that were there. And they got themselves a spot into the promotion tournament, and right before this promotion tournament began they took Rhux and Goldenglue, took them out of the lineup, and brought in these two Koreans that they'd just flown in, like unknown Koreans that were just from soloQ or something, called Miracle and Ringer - I mean Ringer's a great name for this particular scenario, but you know, [synchronous?] and all that.
So they brought these in as the solo laners, and there was this huge backlash from the community who were like what the fuck, like Rhux and Goldenglue earned those spots, they got you to that promotion tournament thing, this is so fucked up, that this organization would mistreat them that way and throw them away in that way, they didn't get a chance to qualify in this sense, and then what seemed to satisfy and kind of allay the anger of people who were upset at this was that in the promotion tournament they played Evil Geniuses, they lost 0-3 in the best of five, and so they were out to qualify for the LCS. Now they weren't actually because as it turned out, they ended up being the, oh no wait a second, this was for the Spring, yeah, let me think actually. This was after the summer season, cuz obviously you play during the summer season. So it was at the end of the summer season that this qualifier took place. So this was for the spring of this year, 2015, and because of that, technically it turned out there would be an expansion tournament, because the league expanded to 10 spots, so they did have a place there, but those Koreans left anyways.
So anyways, you can see that that's where the outrage initially started. So now skip forwards this year, to almost a similar point in time, and the team's gotten in a position where they've qualified into LCS, and so people are thinking like oh, great, I mean a number of these players are quite popular that they had on their team, like Cris, the former top laner, I think he was the top laner of, em, Curse Academy, right? They have Shrimp, who is like this highly touted jungler, people are like oh, wait for this guy to get into LCS, he's been hard carrying the team, and then they obviously have DontMashMe, who's always been a reasonably popular player, he's had a history pre-LCS and people obviously wanted to see how would he do when he got back into LCS.
But the problem is, November 16th, the team officially sells its LCS slot to NRG. Then, the new team is announced, and the new team is Impact, former top laner of TIP and SK Telecom, Moon, they had GBM, who's the former midlaner of Jin Air Green Wings, and they had KonKwon, who actually had briefly been in the Coast team before, and then now they've just added Altec as their AD Carry. So a very good lineup on paper, actually, potentially a team that has a chance to win LCS and can be very competitive. Much more competitive, as an aside, than the lineup that Coast had that qualified for LCS, you'll note, which would have been in theory a bottom feeder team, or maybe battling to maybe make the bottom of the playoffs.
Now the problem here is that I understood why initially there were concerns about hmm, have they actually fucked up in terms of the residency rules, like who's gonna be counted here. According to LolEsportspedia the players counted as the "NA players" there are Moon, Altec, and KonKwon, for different reasons there. So that seems plausible that might work, but what's strange is, when people got so upset, they always kept emphasizing this aspect - that these players -earned- this, they got you to that point, and now you're discarding them, and so you're sort of like screwing them over.
Now here's the problem. So people are upset that a team qualified to the LCS, or in the past, the thing from 2014, wasn't even LCS, they just qualified to the promotion match, to get into LCS, so even just the process, even the progression of how you get towards LCS people were apparently upset, if you get part-way through and you're not retained. And yet what they're upset at is that the organization attempted to upgrade the players. At least in the minds of the organization. Now, first and foremost, if that's the case, then where are these fans or commentators or analysts or whoever it is who's commenting on this sort of stuff, where, when should you be allowed to change players, and under what circumstances. If you have an opportunity with a team, as an owner, to get a better player, and you're gonna spend your fucking money to do so, an upgrade to that position and have a chance for your franchise to do better now - when are you allowed to do that? There's no, I mean, if you're gonna make arbitrary rules you're gonna have to set terms for that. Because by the same logic here's where it gets inconsistent, the outrage.
Think of this. If we're using the logic that it's cuz you earned something, because you did something with your play, and that leads to something that follows afterward in a linear fashion, you now deserve to be a part of that, because if it wasn't for you you wouldn't have got to that part, which no one can deny. You wouldn't have gotten to that part, but the question goes like this - what goes beyond that? Because here's an interesting factor that people didn't seem to have noticed. If you go onto esportspedia and you look up the team, so for Cris and DontMashMe, and DontMashMe's one of the players that people wanted to see in LCS, their contracts are listed as ending on November 16. So if that's the case, their contracts had ended.
Now, what, is the team obliged to sign another contract with these players? That seems ridiculous. What, just because they qualified - no, the contracts ended. We finished paying you, thanks for your services, you did a great job. Now we're choosing to go a different route. That seems entirely reasonable to me.
It's another thing when they're under contract - ok, so now let's discuss that sort of a scenario. So first and foremost, let's think about this. So since people were upset that they got to a certain point and then the team didn't retain them, let's use the same logic for other parts of the LCS system. So now let's imagine a player who plays for let's say Elements, as an example, in Europe, cuz famously they haven't got relegated, but they keep dropping into that slot where you're safe from relegation, you don't make the playoffs, but you're safe from relegation, they've been in like that seventh slot. So if you finish seventh with Elements, by the same logic fans are using now, you helped Elements avoid relegation, so that they couldn't get relegation, and as a result Elements is gonna be in the next LCS split, so by the logic of these fans you should be outraged if that player, wants the player from, but is not given the same spot again in a similar contract. Because by your logic, he earned them that next spot in LCS, therefore he should be allowed to play in the next LCS spot. Now that's ridiculous, I don't know anyone who would argue for that position, and I don't know anyone if they heard that Elements was gonna upgrade that player and get a better player or maybe even a Korean player who's really good who'd be super mad over it. That would seem quite ridiculous to me.
Likewise, let's say your team in LCS does go into relegations, and you play in the relegation match, and you win the relegation match, and you're back in LCS. So think of teams that have done this before - Copenhagen Wolves, Gambit, over in Europe. Now, some of those players have then been changed out, upgraded, I remember we had Kubon who was playing at some time for Gambit, he didn't get to play the next split after that. So why don't those players get to get retained again and have to be re-signed and have to have another place, why are you allowed to upgrade over those player, I don't know anyone arguing over this.

Let's go the other way. Let's say, in terms of success, in the LCS Spring split, let's say your team either wins the split, or places quite highly, and then the team decides not to use you for the summer split or doesn't retain your services, or upgrades over you and just benches you, whatever. In this scenario, with the circuit point system, they might then be able to later qualify for Worlds as a result of some of the circuit points you helped them get. So by the same logic, there should be a similar sort of outrage, it should be this is bullshit, this is unfair. Now this is the problem with this sort of outrage - it's so arbitrary, people are saying it as though it's like some righteous anger that's totally based on, oh everyone can agree this is fucked up, this is totally wrong, obviously it's so obvious we have to change something. It's not obvious, I mean it seems very arbitrary over who people get outraged over and what situations, and as far as I can tell, it seems largely the reason why people are outraged cuz either they like a player like DontMashMe, either they remember that old situation where they felt fucked over by Rhux and Goldenglue not getting a chance to qualify for the promotion thing, where admittedly in that scenario they didn't then have an opportunity in theory to go to some of the other teams, they could've actually, but it wouldn't have happened, cuz of how close it was. And thirdly, they wanted to see how like a young guy like Shrimp might do if he got his chance in LCS - ok, those are all great, but those are your personal feelings about something, they're not really anything to do with any legislation that should be put in place, or anything "moral". You just don't want that player to be removed, that's it. There's no moral obligation where they've done something wrong and ethically fucked up by doing so.
Likewise, the way you can show how arbitrary this outrage is, is let's ask how many players does it apply to. So I've given situations where it applies that people don't actually apply it. So how many players does it apply to. Are you allowed to upgrade one player? Ok, so I'm allowed to upgrade one player, am I? Am I allowed to upgrade two players - oh, wait, but two players is what made the Coast problem - oh, ok, can I do two players? Or maybe ok, maybe just this time one time I can do two players. Well is it three, is three the key number that fucks everything up. See what I mean, it's just totally arbitrary. In theory, by that logic, if it's fucked up to do it to three players, it's fucked up to do it to two players, and it's fucked up to do it to one player. There's no reason why having three would make it better than one in that scenario - I mean it does obviously make it worse, but in theory it should still be equally wrong to do it to one player. So by this logic, certainly, unless your team's in some perfect spot, where the last season didn't have much of an impact on anything, you can't remove or add any players suddenly, according to this sort of outrage.
Now here's the problem I see with this situation. Before I get into the sports aspect, cuz it obviously ties in there. These people who've played in these teams, are paid, and employed, for what they do now. Not what's gonna happen in the future - that's the way that a fan thinks. They are paid for their performances now, and that is their job. So it's from when they were signed, up until now. And when the team decides to get rid of them, that's the end of their employment there, ok that's it. You would never obliged to give them something extra, you were never promising them something extra, there was never any implication that they'd definitely get something extra because of what they've done now. Even if they did a great job now - thank you for your services, good job, we've decided to go a different direction.
These players - put it this way - aren't in any way somehow now mini-owners of the team, who now own some sort of equity in the future, in the success of the team, depending on what they did and what they built into it. They're literally, I mean to use, to get a bit abstract here in terms of just a normal employment scenario. These players are literally wage slaves who are playing now purely for the wage that they receive during each week that they play now during their contract and according to their contract they're allowed to be released and removed and not used in the team anymore, and that's entirely fine within the system that we have. And by the way, that's not an LCS system that you want to get mad at, that's the fucking Western employment system, which by the way I agree is kind of fucked up - you don't get any sort of equity for your efforts within the system that you work in, but unless you guys want to have like some revolution where we bring along some sort of anarchal capitalist system, I don't think we're gonna fix that overnight using fucking Challenger and League of Legends systems. So I think you might be going down the wrong road there.
Now there's also the factor that, if they are released from these teams, if they're such wonderful players who "deserve" spots and have earned spots and all the rest of that jazz, why don't other teams in LCS fight over them and pick them up perhaps very cheaply if they've been released for free, and get them into their teams. Now I will admit, the Riot system of anti-poaching and when their contracts become available makes it a lot harder for said players to find spots, because other teams are already scouting out who they're gonna offer to, and maybe making really quick offers, so they don't get locked in the, get lost in the transfer window, and miss their opportunity. So that does kind of fuck over players, as I've mentioned in past video. But even regardless, the reason why a lot of these players won't be picked up, is because guess what, other teams out there also want to have really good teams and they won't downgrade to get some of these players. Now admittedly in the case of someone like Shrimp maybe it's different, and maybe he will wind up on a team. But in the case of some of these other players, these other LCS teams wouldn't want them. Therefore yes, they earned their spot by qualifying up, but it's not the case that they're particularly LCS-calibre players who definitely have to be in LCS.
I mean, to give you an example, this happens all the time in football. As in, you'll get teams in soccer, as you Americans call it, where they might get promoted from another division, and the team they had in that division was good enough to win the division or get very high and get promoted, but once you get to the next level, like the premiership for example, your team might now not be good enough to play, as in you're not gonna have any chance of making the top part of the league and be in the bottom part fighting against relegation the whole time. So as a result if you have the opportunity and the money and the spending you're gonna try and upgrade certain positions even though that guy who'd gotten you to this point, cuz he was good enough to play in that one, that's why you paid him for that, you now get someone who's better for the next division - it's logical, it makes perfect sense.

Likewise, that is the business of sports. These players, by the way, act in their interests. The teams, act in their own interests. Now the reason I say, each is acting in their own interests, cuz that's another part where the outrage is inconsistent, because no one goes the other way. So let's imagine the same scenario. So think of a team like H2K, this sort of a team. Surely these teams could now argue, for someone like Kasing, like oh, I gave you a platform, I mean, H2K brought in Kasing when he was just some failed guy who'd been on MYM who wasn't particularly impressive there, and no one knew he'd be super good when he got onto H2K and as good as he was. So they could say the logic, surely, oh you have to sign with us next season, Kasing. Uh, why is that, my contract's up. Oh you have to sign with us because we gave you the exposure, and the platform, we gave you a starting spot, and as a result of that you did well, and you even got to go to worlds and showed up, and that's why you're now getting this chance potentially to play next split and also why you're getting these offers, so if you're gonna be, to be fair, to not be like fucked up ethically, morally, in this world of fans, you should have to resign with us, because you know, that would be the right thing to do, Kasing.
No, no one thinks that way, in fact no one has a problem ever when players leave teams that aren't that good and upgrade to really good teams, like - not even necessarily really good teams, but really good orgs. Like a TSM, even a CLG, who have a lot of money - these big orgs, no one has a problem when players better their interests and take care of their own situation and improve their own scenario. Even though it might fuck over the old team who was relying on them and built a team around team.
Remember when NiP was building a team around fucking Bjergsen before he went to TSM - they signed Kevin, the top laner of SK, he was one of the stars of the league at the time, and they signed hyrqBot, who was considered one of the better junglers, for money, an actual buyout fee, early on in League of Legends at the end of Season 3, and yet Bjergsen then just went to TSM, got a better scenario, in fact did some poaching himself to get the team so that it still even worked. They'd already spent money on that. What, is everything gonna go oh that's fucked up Bjergsen, that you'd leave that team and go to a better team like TSM and have a chance to go to worlds. No, no one said any of that shit, no one had that outrage. The outrage is inconsistent in this scenario, especially when you try to put it into different perspectives, and like you do the thought experiment for different teams.
Now I'll tell you one thing that is consistent at all times, and you really do get what you do deserve there, you get what you've earned for your performance, and that's Alpha Draft. So if you want to play fantasy esports, where you could put any of these players on a team, if they're in LCS, and that could be your lineup, and you could potentially win money, and respect, then go ahead and go to AlphaDraft.com. If you don't want to, shut up, don't be outraged about that, it's just me making scrilla.
