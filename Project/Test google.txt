the brand new league of Legends organization and I G owned by the
Sacramento Kings owner apparently signing what was formerly coasts
organization buying it but not signing the players are making this new roster
has sparked a level of outrage which ties back into a previous incident or
scandal whatever you want to call it that involves coast from last year and
this is a topic which I found a little bit confusing because people's outrage
while I can understand and sympathize with some of the the base reasons or
emotions behind it doesn't seem to be well placed all logically for our and
that the reasons behind it doesn't do very well defined yet they're calling
for like rule changes or something must be done yet seems that the people our
age don't necessarily know exactly what they want doing or how it would
reasonably implemented across all teams not just this specific case so first of
all let's just break down the details of this it all began last year in 2014 when
Coast gotten relegated from after this spring's playoffs that year and if you
remember after the relegation zone spot and shifted
superstar acquisitions of did you get a chance and so Costa said she had to
start again with a lot of its lineup intend to Lex left they were put in a
position where they had to like pull the whole new roster and so they put
together this roster which other number of players you probably don't have a
crock sets and told her in the gold included with Fusion honors apollo that
sheep later on they would get me as i guess i buy something and what happened
was they were going through the pre season summer season tournaments they're
trying to qualify they were lucky all the different elements that were there
and they got themselves a spot into the promotion tournament and right before
this promotion to a big gun they took rocks and Golden Globe took a lot of the
lineup and brought in these two Koreans unknown koreans which is a great name
for this particular
so they brought these innocent solo lenders and there was this huge backlash
from the community who were like what the fuck like bricks and rocks and gold
lured those spots they got you that promotion to admit things so fucked up
the opposition would mistreat them
way throw them away that way they don't get a chance to qualify in the sense and
then what seemed to satisfy kind of a laid their anger of people who are upset
this was like in the provision to admit they played evil geniuses they play they
lost zero to three in the best-of-five and so they were out of coffee LCS they
weren't actually because as it turned out that ended up being like this is for
this spring they let me think actually this was after this season was obviously
played during the summer season was at the end of the summer season one disc or
so this was for the spring of this year 2015 and because of that technically it
would be an expansion because the league expanded to 10 spots so they did a place
there but I was koreans left anyway so we can see that that's what the outrage
initially start and I'm skeptical woods this year to almost a similar point in
time and the teams got in a position where they've qualified Intel CIS so
people are thinking like great i mean these players are quite popular they had
on their team I Chris the former top layer top layer of economy might shrink
this highly touted jungle Oh people I can't wait for this kinda getting also
has been hard carrying the team and then they obviously don't like me who's
always been a reasonably popular player I had a history pre LCS and people
obviously wanted to see how would he do when he got back in osseous but the
problem is November 16th the team officially sells its LCS lot energy when
a new team has announced a new team is in part two former top layer of type II
SK Telecom moon GBM moves from a middle layer of General Greene wings and they
had Quan Quan who actually briefly been in because team before and then now they
just added all Tigers already carries a very good lineup on paper
potentially has a chance to win yeltsin can be very competitive much more
competitive as an aside then they line up the coast had qualified yes you'll
know it which would have been in theory about 32 team may be battling to maybe
make the bottom of the playoffs now the problem here is that I understood why
initially there were concerns about how they actually like fucked up in terms of
the
residency rules like who's going to be a constant lot speedier the players
counted as the only players there are moon all taken corn corn for different
reasons they're so that seems plausible that might work but what Strange's when
people got so upset he always kept emphasizing this aspect that these
players earned they got to that point I know you're discarding them and so
you're sort of like screwing them over now here's the problem so people are
upset
qualified to the officers or in the past the thinking 2014 was named as a yes
qualified to the promotion much to get into LCI so even just the process even
the proper aggression of how you get to 100 people apparently upset you get part
way through not retained and yet there is that the organization attempted to
operate the players at least in the minds of the organization now first and
foremost if that's the case then where are these funds are all commentators or
analysts or whoever is your commenting on this stuff where when when should you
be allowed to change plans and under what circumstances if your opportunity
with a team as an owner to get a better player and you're gonna spend your money
to do so
an upgrade at the position and have a chance to your franchise to do better
now when I you know there's not a mean if you can make arbitrary rules you have
to set terms with that because by the same logic is where it gets inconsistent
the outrage think of this before using the logic that earned something because
you did something with your play and that leads to something that follows
afterwards in a linear fashion you know deserve to be a part of that because it
wasn't for you you would have got up I was no one can deny you would have
gotten to a point where the question goes like this what goes beyond that
because here's an interesting fact that people didn't seem to have noticed if
you go into any sports media and you look up the team so for Chris and don't
wash mean she's all the plays of people wanted to see no cos they're playing
their contracts are listed as ending on November 16th so if that's the case then
contracted ended now what's the team applied to sign another contract with
these players that seems ridiculous just because they know the contract ended
which finished paying you thanks for your services you do a great job now
we've chosen to go a different route
entirely reasonable to me another thing when they are under contract ok so not
discuss that supports Obama's let's think about this so since people are
upset that they got to a certain point and then the team did return them less
use the same logic but other parts of the osseous system so it's a marginal
player who plays for that same elements as an example in the Europe has famously
they haven't got relegated but they keep dropping into that slot we are safe from
relegation you don't make the playoffs be safe from relegation maybe like seven
slow so if you finish seventh with elements by the same logic funds are
using now you helped elements avoid relegation so they couldn't get
relegated and as a result elements is going to be in the next a split so by
the logic of these funds you should be outraged if that player wants to play
from this but it's not given the same spot again in a similar contract because
by your logic he owned them that exporting LCS therefore you should be
allowed to play the next spot that's ridiculous I don't know anyone who would
argue that position they heard the elements are going to upgrade the plane
gotta play medieval Korean place it will be super model read quite ridiculous to
me
likewise let's say your team in LCS does go into allegations and you play in the
relegation much and you win the relegation much and you're back in
osseous so think of teams that done this before Copenhagen wolves gambit over in
europe now some of those players have there been changed our operated remember
where we had a coupon was playing at some point in time for government to
play the next play after that so why don't those players get to get returned
again and have to be re-signed have to have another place where you allowed to
upgrade over those players I don't know anyone argue over this let's go the
other way let's say in terms of success in the ALCS spring split let's say your
team either wins the split or places quite highly and then the team decides
not to use you for the summer split or doesn't retain your services or upgrades
over ugh benches you whatever in this scenario with the circuit court system
they might then be able to later qualify for worlds as a result of some of the
circuit point to help them get so by the same logic there should be a simple
assault this is bullshit that this is the problem with this sort of outrage
its sole arbitrator people are saying is that sucks I'm righteous anger that
solely based at the table
obviously so obvious to change something obvious if it seems very arbitrary over
people get outraged over exaggerations and as far as I can tell it seems
largely the reason why people are outrageous cause I like a plan I don't
rush me either they remember that old situation with a foot fucked over by
rocks and golden do not get a chance to qualify for a promotion thing where
admittedly not sorry they didn't have a DVD go to some of the other teams they
could about what happened was my closet and thirdly they wanted to see our
younger guys Johnson cok Ozel grip with us your personal feelings or something
that I really could do without getting soft legislation should be put in place
or anything moral
you just don't want to be removed it there's not there's no moral obligation
wrong and ethically fucked up by doing so likewise the way you can show how
between us our ages is let's ask how many players that have given situations
there were people don't apply it so how many players to play I like to upgrade
one player ok ok great to play with players who made the coast from Cape May
beach this time one time I can do to bus 33 the key number that fucks everything
so I mean it's just told the arbitrary in theory but what you want them to do
it to three players W two players and it's what to do to one player there's no
reason why having three would make it better than one another and docks make
it worse but you should still be equally wrong to remove the one player by this
logic suddenly unless your teams in some perfect spot where the last season
didn't have much of an impact anything you can remove or add any players
suddenly according to the sort of outrage
now here's the problem I see with this situation before I get into the spot
suspect was obviously ties in there
these people who've played in these teams are paid unemployed for what they
do now know what's going to happen in the future that's that's always fun
things they are paid for their performances now and that is their job
search from when they were signed up until now
and when the team decides to get rid of them that's the end of their employment
their ok that's it you would never obliged to give them something extra you
never promising to making extra was never any implication that they
definitely get some protection because of what they've done now even did a
great job now thank you for your services good job we decided to go a
different direction if the these players put its way onto in any way somehow now
many owners of the team who now own some sort of equity in the future and the
success of the team depending on what they did and they built into it there
literally I mean to use it to go get a bit abstract here in terms of just a
normal employment that these players are literally wage slaves were playing now
purely for the set the wage that they receive during each week they played
under the contract and they're allowed to be released and removed and not used
in the treatment and that's all entirely fine within the system we have and by
the way that's not an LCS system you wanna get western employment system
which by the way I agree is kind of fucked up you don't get any sort of a
query our efforts within the system that you work with but unless you guys wanna
like have some great revolution will bring along some sort of an alkyl
capitalist system and I think we're going to fix up overnight using fucking
challenger and League of Legends also system self I think you might be going
down the wrong road there now there's also the fact that if they are released
from these teams if they're such wonderful players who deserve spots in
earned spots all the rest of that just why don't other teams in LCS by over
there and pick them up pops very cheaply the memories for free and get those
places that teams now I want to meet the right the riot system of like
anti-poaching on when their contracts become available
makes it a lot harder for second place to find spots because all the teams are
already scouting out who they can offer to it may be making really quick offers
so they don't get locked in the ghetto get lost in the transfer window and
mister opportunities that does kind of Aqaba players I've already mentioned a
possible deals but you regardless the reason why don't these players will be
picked up
guess what other teams out there also what are really good teams and they
won't like downgrade to get some of these players that maybe it's different
and maybe he will wind up on a team but in the case of some of the other players
they wouldn't these other obviously wouldn't want them therefore yes they
earned their spot by coughing up but it's not the case that they're
particularly LCS caliber players who
me to give you an example this happens all the time in football as in you'll
get teams in soccer as you call it where they might get promoted from another
division and the team they had in that division was good enough to win the
division get very highly promoted but once you get to the next level like the
Premiership for example your team might not now not be good if the players and
you do not have any chance of making a top are really going to be the bottom
part fighting against relegation all times as a result the opportunity the
money in the spending you gonna try and upgrade to that guy brought you to this
point because he was good enough to play in that one that's what you paid him for
that you know get some things better for the next logical it makes perfect sense
likewise that he is the business of sports these players by the way back in
their interests the team's act in their own interests the reason I say each
other acting in the region that's another part with the outrages
inconsistent because no one goes the other way so that so much in the same
scenario so think of it seemed like hedge 2k this sort of a team
surely these teams could now argue for someone like I gave you a platform I
mean increasing when he was just some failed guy was particularly impressive
that no one knew he'd be super good when he got into a good school is he was so
they could say the same logic surely I will have to sign with us next season
Anand you have to sign with us because we gave you the exposure and the
platform we gave you a starting spot and as a result of that you did well and
you've got to go to worlds showed up and that's why you know getting this chance
potentially to play next there and also why you getting his office so if you're
gonna be you know to be fair to not be like fuck top ethically morally in this
world of bands you should have to reason with us because you know i mean that
would be the right direction
no no one no one has a problem when players leave teams that aren't that
good and upgrade two really good teams like not even the city really good
really good or even a sealed you would know a lot of money these big dogs no
one has a problem players better their interests and take care of their own
situation and improve their own scenario it might take over the whole team that
was relying on the mobility mound
remember when an IP was building that team around putting buicks and before
you at CSN Bay signed the top of the stars in the league at the time and they
signed hook but was considered one of the better journalist for money and
actual contract buyout early on in the elections at the end of season three and
yes yes I'm good about star in fact it's and poaching himself to get the teams
still even worked they'd already spent money on that was ever got fucked up you
actually don't seem too much as I would have a chance to go to worlds know no
one said I should know that rage the outrages inconsistent this area
especially when you try and put into different perspectives like you do the
experiment with different teams now tell me one thing that is inconsistent at all
times and that you really do get what you deserve their you get what you pay
for your performance and that's all for drafts of you wanna play fantasy sports
where you could put any of these players on the team if there are also yes and
that could be online up he could potentially win money and respect then
go ahead and got after call me if you don't want to then shut up don't be
outraged about that it's just me make its guerrilla
