there's no rush but while I still exists in this incarnation I thought I'd be
sneaky and tell you about alpha draft fantasy sports service where you can
play all different types of a sports game by all different types of contest
also Montecristo when I play there see you never know you might meet yes in a
contest with the high amount of money to be won thousands and possibly end up on
cloud nine
not the actual team is like a figure if place that people talk about in
phraseology if not I just tried again balls London now that we're tied to the
video scrilla so cloud nine has just added two players to the roster there I
did rush and divided bunny fufu as the substitute support player where
presumably hi will mostly star as their support and they will rotate money for
free and we'll see how it goes gonna be six man roster now where cloud nine were
last split was far from what we ever think of with club now they were team
that always made the finals previously that won two straight and they also sell
LCS titles and then they'd finished second twice a split was a disaster
everyone saw the highest individual game is a mid laner wasn't strong enough for
the region is having a lot of difficulty nationally so they brought an
inclination to strong solid you play with all this hype behind him but he
added issues integrating into the team losing hi I'm at the shop calling went
to shit to some degree it was clearly in fighting in the team like me you're so
happy
paul started to drop off a cliff completely so what they did was we just
left the team that brought high in as a jungler know how I had a lot of
difficulty adapting as a jungler and ended up finishing in seventh place they
didn't make the playoffs but the new format for qualifying for worlds meant
that they were in the gauntlet to qualify for the third spot the third
seed for worlds they made this great gauntlet run where it's like they were
dominant like they were like super impressive they just barely were able to
just sneak past every opponent mainly just by getting to the game and and team
fighting the way with decent shot calling around
and they got two worlds but then they were imports 3 because they were the
third seed but they got one in theory I group that wasn't impossible as a third
seed at least these people are you had a chance to be ok fanatic you baby with
all they wouldn't do
Invictus gaming ok they were themselves are shaky seed coming out of China and
then obviously HQ is strong but most people don't know about the strength of
the LMS teams now amazingly glad I came out they 30 the first week we had this
great style I was suddenly playing decent jungle champions before he'd been
stuck on a movie and Shibani really look like a messenger of individual players
shockley been decent but improved so club an improvement gotten his boy
world's and I was shocked for a team that was kind of understaffed in terms
of talent and the group so they won the first two games then they lost the next
reynosa tiebreaker didn't get the playoffs at worlds but all in all you
could see was a good operate progression trend trajectory was nice but it was
also detected that was like pretty much like that maxed out the gym complicated
gotten the most exotic spices supposition we used to being in getting
upset most of all the players but if they were ever gonna be a content of
worlds of they were going to be a team critical of worlds changes we're going
to happen and that's what's happened now so for me the main storylines in the
last split balls had huge issues never really overcame them on a few times
higher difficulty adapting to the jungle mainly as an individual player head
really poor champion Paul then it got ok but his shot calling once your doctor
doing it from the young girl god she's pretty good close to his like midline
level by the end and more importantly in coloration eventually did come from this
player who seem to be shocked when he was on stage and sing to be like
initially just trying to be like the new millennium not make too much noise in
terms of complaining but like a jungle pressure or maybe was obsessed with oil
pressure but eventually i coming in my understanding like that's what this guy
needs to be really aside from these my only carry plant the seeds I'm going to
jungle limitations not really that great support plenty more balls off dead man
walking
so that point in time it was understood that you needed in condition to be good
so the focus and he did and he was able to improve resumed able to approve a
stage performance is carrying potential went through the roof and now he became
like a strong mid laner I wouldn't say is really at the level of Buicks and
development quite yet but he did have individual games with you I carry Blair
was definitely the reason why they want and even played well in some of the
losses which is quite impressive so you take that team and now you are doing
these new place I didn't rush formerly of team impulse to IP the first thing to
say about rush anyone who doesn't understand what the West because it's
true solid in the west is in general garbage displays have been number one
who will never be close to invest in that position even in LCS mainly cuz of
people not trying as much and is not being the culture ontology meaning a lot
but what's interesting is when the whole balls diamond to worrying trend mean
came out and people are trying to show back like western Plaza yeah but who
cares about so lucky you know so yeah
in the west the problem is in korea it does mean something was in korea all the
top pros are still available Lehigh games that's how I was able to retain
his spot for so long because he was always been a top five individual plans
on a key so it's never like they could say or even if you had issues in the
game
work on these issues you look at some of the players they have all the top
players in near the top of the Sala cue there's also Chinese players playing all
the time
top pros they're trying to show how good they are elements pros planes and time
so actually incredibly competitive LMS expert and commentator climate Chu even
said in the Korean solo q ranked really is like a good determine how good you
are like players weren't that good I just never gonna have a shot challenger
in korea it will never happen for them so competitive so I the reason this
context up is roche is probably the best player we've ever seen in NLCS in terms
of his level in solo queue as of like the time he's played in an LCS number of
times before a joint
that I've joined him under a different points in time every time he goes back
to Korea he's getting ranked warren he's the best players in career to some
degree he's having games with you watch the stream games he's like hard carrying
brutalize and the other team reckon eligible and get canceled them up when
he's playing against fake deftly these gone like players from Korea so this is
a phenomenally talented player especially as a hard carry junglist I'll
player one who does it by getting ganked of all time is not just that use it gets
key he gets by do much like he's the guy gets a gang is going to turn that into
another gang is going to his two kills is going to go buy an item you can use
that to do a damage and snowball snow ball which is potentially very excited
for this like the Garden Club not know how you look at him as a player I think
tip for me when I looked at that team was basically all about the impact to
rush impact of super stable russia and could play catch-up IANS russia's this
carried away he was clearly the star the problem with tips for me was when jobs
Yahoo was really her like a wild card point I player it was really up and down
to being a champion book could carry the game when he had the right champion he
was the problem is one thing that put him in a situation where they have this
inexperienced guy with a very limited young people basically is here and you
had to put him on just super supportive shaped like a loser cuz you put him on
that who knows why they then put themselves right will know the carey has
to be eighty carrier paula was like a clean up eighty carriers so instead they
made impact just be this stable talk later was placed himself and they put
all the damage until like because more of the eighty carry whereas impact
probably soon to be a career playing not matter and there with rush you can
snowball fight because they worried about how great would do in the midline
so I think rush as good as he looked at me to look great in the playoffs he
could have been better like I actually thought they'd had a job that would have
been a really interesting series between tip and sealed unit wouldn't have been
as clear cut as it was they could have contended
potential to make the final and inside they had on his back so to me he was
like the MVP level candidates now what's interesting is when he comes in a cloud
one of the really good things is first of all that he's now going to be able to
help out incarnation not least because they've got both the top-line numbers
are you looking at the Team Foundation he's the main teri playing the team
along with sneaky boy differences super carry mid laner can obviously do a lot
more is at the moment even a really good idea to carry at least in the previous
to play around the team to some degree if you can get incarnation rolling you
have a really good chance to win the game as well with the snowball carried
out john loves to get sick dunks off this is ideal for it he can get snowball
themselves secondly he's gonna have constant pressure so that whole worry
used to have one thing I talked to him about it and he was so concerned about
was he was the kind of place where maybe cuz you was need to the stage
environment he felt like he needed like full version control all on the mid and
they needed to know he could play aggressive and harass the guy because he
needed to know that wouldn't be enough brush that was so worried that he went
forward here tried to carry his land try to get there cos advantage that he would
just get repeated again and that he would throw the game analysis and the
last thing you want to do with a guy feeding amid likes a brand new play all
the rest of played it for many years and he's supposed to be the savior you can
see the pressures that were on him and that was clearly in his murder was
clearly fucking with him but it was great I remember that interview where I
said something along the lines of the he told incarnation like something was it
something along the lines of like if you let me if you carry me then I'll carry
you too will to some some line along those lines is all like it was like
you're gonna be the carrier player and if you can just carry the game to rest
I'll get the team in position where would you like help free so we russians
super-duper john wants to go wants to make place therefore it should get ready
to pack up let's go now the other madeline is gonna be worried about where
Russia's NTV those worried should be gone in countries should be freed to be
as good as he was at World's End
you also look at the fact that you'll be concerns during the games were you don't
play high is the sport player you don't have that shot calling and high special
holistically in terms of understanding of the whole mapping out of play the
matter since you're not going to have that shocking some of the time you'd
hope by having the super-strong Kerry Jang LA and now having this really
strong mid later that you can snowball games more to the point we don't have to
do those amazing comebacks we think of with the old club knows a lot of a great
shock came in having to be in a tense mid game where you then it was a great
call me when injected decides how you win the game so I think crush
competition be a very very good what's interesting as well as he made the
comment is structured interview he climbed onto used to having carried just
like in self translating role he meant to say but he said that in the sense
that we do or say hi with farm heavy guns what's funny is a rush I don't
think of him as a farm having the courage gets he gets his killed his goal
from from making them up and that's how he dominates the game as long as I
wonder if he just thinks a farm jungle asked how you're going to be so far have
it is just gonna be beasting all over the map that's that's how it is best and
he has the potential to be the best jungler
split that's that's absolutely interesting in itself especially because
no one seemed to go against the fence karen i'll be very interesting because
those were to meet with the two beasts k junglers of their regions last split so
when you look at the fact that they brought him bunny fufu know when I first
heard the rumors running buddy food who obviously the initial assumption was
that the writing was a permanent player at the time it sounded like initially
said this in a post about that it was going to depend whether they could get
it
jungles important maybe they don't like I as a jungler they couldn't get a good
jungler and they just put someone else's supports I thought maybe it means that
you cannot hide young learn how to shop there may be sure buddy foods he's a
good player
in regular splits time he's been a very good plays bball the bestest position
but you look at his playoff runs and there's still a bit shaky shaky but he
just lays ok but it doesn't live up to the level that we've seen when he's in
regular split and he's one of those players were still has to be said he
improved a lot in overseas while the guys who was born the first using Chen
support was getting a lot of effectiveness of that initially be used
towards the end on the issues is yeah he's amazing it fresh
but he's also player where if you just by his treasury does limit him into the
passports in terms of how much as a potential to make karyotype incredible
place himself in in the games that's something that might be freed up but
also might still be a constant improvement says likewise shopaholic
individual play in the regular split seemed decent times it was good but
hasn't really ascended like a top tier level yet times it was clearly offers
well you look at the end of this but when they were losing were clearly some
key mistakes being made it is hard I have to admit to judge gravity because
of the fact that to me
gravity was so influenced by what i consider kind of bullshit pits by Keane
Keane was the ultimate best of one player
overseas he was never gonna be a beast he was never going to dominate the whole
suits them best ones could catch you off with these weird pics especially that
won't matter if it's in any sense of the wouldn't even become more pics that may
only work once or twice but you will be able to get them to work and then hit
his abusive way of playing what she did get those kills on those champions but
these were almost like 10 games that were gonna be able to be replicated
later anyway so it wasn't a good style is hard to judge how some of the other
players will play i think as a result people like holds looked worse when
they're in the playoffs because my complete shit and also they were never
on the right side them up if you remember those that scenario where they
had the choice to have an extra game on the side amount that they would all
previously got loads of their wins on what to resolving the place i mean i
well so funny foo foo is the fact that he's a sob other starters what's so
interesting because I would hope even though it wasn't like this we can learn
things up each other like baby bunny fufu can help highlands of things ok
true but to me the main thing to have on TV
for high as shit injury problems but secondly so hopefully train some of his
shock faculties no I don't think shock calling us something that is just as
simple as other areas they get to sit down the drain it and let it I do think
everyone can improve a bit so my main thing without you I would hope the body
from going to be watching and listening to all these games and just trying to
figure out how to say hi with in high style of shock how does he figure out
what he's gonna do when the team went to the right place in a game or a moment to
make this sort of a comment also what's hi doing in terms of what he says what's
behind that I guess he is he saying this right now 'cause tactical vest or is he
saying this right now to allay the fears of some of the nation's concern that I
call them I can be made in a second was he telling balls again we can play safe
for a little bit is that cause he's just sees them up that way that player the
way he sees the game and then being able to deconstruct unhappily food reassembly
how he sees the game not as a replica but as like taking what works and trying
to see what would work for him that Toomey's potentially the most
interesting part of this move in the future they cling forever we also
definitely don't know that I will be a good support plan so they're going to
need to work to me but if you who has to be like a work in progress that is going
towards the goal of eventually him becoming the starter now he becomes the
starter obviously the issue but again as we said when they originally lost hi the
aim is to have a good enough team elsewhere but you have good enough shots
like the majority
team is also the fact that good
because I went into overall expectations in contention for the top spot ahead and
there are still the biggest question is just bought like what's going to happen
with this guy like in the past aside from the first place he played it's
never been the case that you could just put balls on like normal matchups
replace a dozen too much junk jungle pressure did you find the game was never
even the way usually it was more like he played his specific champions and then
certain games you double chance he would carry and then in the spring of 2014
one of the main carries stars of the team he had two species since then he
didn't look good at world even in the end in a couple of games they want it
was like a lot of other factors were part of that still a big concert for me
admittedly the rest of the team to improving its in a good place for the
moment I Pennsylvania
third or fourth level team we'll see how it goes thanks to offer
